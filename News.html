        Premier League referees work under an instruction that contact must have a consequence if a spot kick is to be awarded, while the attacker should go down in a way which fits that contact.

        On first viewing, it looked like Jota had simulated without contact. Yet upon watching the replays, the goalkeeper did catch the Liverpool forward's left leg with his left arm. But does that mean this should remain a penalty with such a small amount of contact and a delayed fall?

        Yet with the weight a referee's decision on the field carries, and the high threshold for a VAR intervention, penalties like this don't tend to get overturned. Any evidence of contact leads to the VAR supporting the on-field call. We saw it with spot kicks awarded against Wolves to Newcastle United and Sheffield United. In both those cases there was negligible contact, though the Premier League's Independent Key Match Incidents Panel said the VAR should have intervened in those cases.</p>

        Senior reporter Rob Dorsett says the Birmingham owners saw Wayne Rooney as a long-term project but had to act after nine defeats in fifteen games.
        Birmingham City have sacked Wayne Rooney after just 15 games in charge.
        
        Rooney was appointed at St Andrew's on October 11 on a three-and-a-half-year deal with the club sixth in the Championship following back-to-back wins under sacked manager John Eustace.
        
        But Rooney has seen his team lose nine of the 15 matches they have played since he took over, leaving the club in 20th place in the Championship table.

        Former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch and England U21s head coach Lee Carsley are among the names Birmingham City want to talk to about the managerial vacancy at St Andrews, Sky Sports News has been told.
        
        
        Former Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper was also under consideration, though it's thought he is keen to wait for a job in the Premier League before returning to football management, and so Birmingham are unlikely to pursue him.

    <strong>Players to watch out for in 2024: Who could star in European football this year?</strong></a>UEFA.com picks out the players who have the potential to take European football by storm in 2024.

        Frosinone's Matias Soulé, PSV's Johan Bakayoko, Paris's Warren Zaïre-Emery, Tottenham's Pape Matar Sarr and Benfica's António Silva
        Frosinone's Matias Soulé, PSV's Johan Bakayoko, Paris's Warren Zaïre-Emery, Tottenham's Pape Matar Sarr and Benfica's António Silva
        It's the start of the year and as usual UEFA.com has drawn on its network of reporters, correspondents and editors from across the continent to predict which young players could burst on to the European scene in 2024.
        
        All players must be 21 or under at the start of the year and will be hoping to emulate some of our previous picks in making a huge splash on the European stage – Erling Haaland (2019), Rafael Leão (2020), Jude Bellingham (2021) and Gavi (2022) to name but a few.
        
        Here are the 40 players to make the cut this time...
        <br/>
       <strong> António Silva (POR, 19 – Benfica)</strong>
        Broke into the Benfica side when 18 at the start of 2022/23 and the cultured centre-back has been first choice ever since. A tough defender capable of accurate passing across any distance, he became the youngest player ever to represent Portugal at the World Cup, aged 19 years 33 days.
        
       <strong> Arnau Martínez (ESP, 20 – Girona)</strong>
        The right-back spent several years in Barcelona's La Masia academy but came of age when helping Girona reach the top flight in 2021/22. Capable of carrying the ball forward at pace and supplying incisive passes, the Under-21 international has been a star in Girona's incredible start to this season.
        
       <strong> Noah Atubolu (GER, 21 – Freiburg)</strong>
        Freiburg placed their faith in the Germany U21 goalkeeper following the summer departure of Mark Flekken and Atubolu has not hidden from the challenge, displaying the reactions and distribution that have drawn comparisons with a young Manuel Neuer.
        
       <strong> Johan Bakayoko (BEL, 20 – PSV Eindhoven)</strong>
        Started making an impact for PSV in early 2023 and ended his break-out season with seven goals and five assists. His pace and one-on-one ability make the traditional right-winger a constant threat to defenders, and he made his international debut for Belgium in March.
        
        <strong> Baldanzi (ITA, 20 – Empoli)</strong>
        The attacking midfielder has been at Empoli from the age of eight, while he has represented Italy at numerous age levels and reached the FIFA U-20 World Cup final in 2023, playing in all seven games. Blessed with excellent vision and flair, Baldanzi's passing ability has shone for the Italian side in the past 18 months.</p>
